# Secret Messages

Project for encryption and decryption using 4 different ciphers

1. Caesar
2. Adfgvx
3. Keyword
4. Atbash

## 1. Ceasar

By using mod 27 not mod 26 - added extra character - space (" ")

## 2. Adfgvx

The cipher is based on the 6 letters ADFGVX. In the following example the alphabet is coded with the Dutch codeword 'nachtbommenwerper'. This results in the alphabet: NACHTBOMEWRPDFGIJKLQSUVXYZ. This creates the table below with the letters ADFGVX as column headings and row identifiers

This cipher is using also extra password

## 3. Keyword

A keyword cipher is a form of monoalphabetic substitution. A keyword is used as the key, and it determines the letter matchings of the cipher alphabet to the plain alphabet. Repeats of letters in the word are removed, then the cipher alphabet is generated with the keyword matching to A,B,C etc. until the keyword is used up, whereupon the rest of the ciphertext letters are used in alphabetical order, excluding those already used in the key.

## 4. Atbash

Cipher that is using flipped alphabet

## 5. OTP (One Time Pad)

On top of each encryption OTP can be used where you have an option as well to send message in 5 character blocks

This OTP will as well generate a strong key that corresponds to each message and every time is random.
